## Supported versions

Cairn is pre-1.0 and under active development. Only the most recent release
line receives fixes.

| Version | Supported |
|---|---|
| 0.1.0-alpha.x | Yes |
| < 0.1.0-alpha.1 (obsolete implementation) | No |

## Who can obtain administrator access

State this plainly, because it is the outer boundary of the entire role model
rather than a footnote to it:

**Whoever can set the server's environment and restart the process can always
obtain administrator access.**

When no administrator exists, the account named by `CAIRN_ADMIN_EMAIL` and
`CAIRN_ADMIN_PASSWORD` is created or promoted to `admin` and `active`; an
existing administrator's password and role are not overwritten on restart.

If every administrator has been demoted or disabled, bootstrap promotes the
configured account without changing its existing password or profile.

Two consequences follow, and neither is a defect:

- The environment-named account cannot be demoted, disabled, or have its
  password reset through the API. Each is refused with a message naming
  `CAIRN_ADMIN_EMAIL`.
- Anyone with shell access to the host, or with the ability to change the
  service's environment and restart it, is effectively an administrator whatever
  the `users` table says.

This is correct for a self-hosted server: that person already controls the host
and the database, so the role model was never what stood between them and the
data. It is written down here so that nobody has to infer it from the source, and
so that a deployment which hands out restart permission understands what it is
handing out.

Accounts are otherwise created only by an administrator — through
`POST /api/admin/users`, or locally with `cairn-server users add`. There is no
self-registration route and no self-join route; both were removed as security
fixes.

## Reporting a vulnerability

Please report security issues privately rather than opening a public issue.

Use GitHub's private reporting: **Security → Report a vulnerability** on
<https://github.com/cunilab/Cairn/security/advisories/new>.

Include what you need to describe the issue — affected version, environment,
reproduction steps, and impact. We aim to acknowledge a report within a few
working days and to keep you informed while a fix is prepared. Please give us a
reasonable opportunity to release a fix before disclosing publicly.

## What Cairn stores, and where

Understanding the data boundary is usually the fastest way to judge impact.

- **Local edge.** SQLite under the Cairn home holds project binding, bounded
  structured-event and command spools, delivery receipts, hook correlation,
  and integration metadata. Finite-age returned context is cached in daemon
  memory. The edge does not own canonical knowledge. Safe queued activity is sent to the authorized server;
  offline capture is bounded and may be refused when capacity is exhausted.
- **Canonical server.** PostgreSQL holds accepted safe events, knowledge,
  evidence, sessions, handoffs, governance, and retrieval state. The server
  independently validates event bounds and privacy before accepting them.
- **Excluded material.** Full conversations, raw prompts, transcripts, diffs,
  command output, credentials, and unbounded payloads are not admitted as safe
  memory. Both edge and server screen paths and secrets; a rejected payload
  is reported by policy class without echoing its contents.
- **Credentials.** A server API token is stored in the Cairn home directory
  with restricted local permissions. Protect that directory and the deployment
  environment; logical export does not include credentials.

## Deployment notes

If you run the server components:

- Terminate TLS in front of `cairn-server`; it speaks plain HTTP.
- Set `CAIRN_WEB_ORIGIN` to your web UI origin so browser requests are
  restricted to it.
- Supply `DATABASE_URL` and any secrets through environment variables or your
  orchestrator's secret store. Never bake them into an image.
- Restrict network access to PostgreSQL to the server component.
