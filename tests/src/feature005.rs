//! Shared fixtures for Feature 005 — Server-Authoritative Autonomous Memory.
//!
//! Four things this feature needs that the existing harness does not provide,
//! collected here so no story rebuilds them:
//!
//! 1. **A PostgreSQL fixture at server schema v4** with a project and accounts
//!    already seeded, because almost every Feature 005 assertion is about what
//!    an *authenticated* request may do to a project it may or may not belong
//!    to.
//! 2. **Identical-UUID seed helpers.** `reference_key` must carry the domain,
//!    and the only way to prove it does is to give `project`, `personal`,
//!    `team` and `pattern` records *deliberately the same* UUID and show
//!    nothing collapses them (SC-766, SC-767). A helper that mints random ids
//!    cannot test that.
//! 3. **Authenticated multi-account helpers.** Owner, co-member and outsider,
//!    with tokens, because privacy and ownership are the feature's sharpest
//!    edges and a single-account fixture cannot see them.
//! 4. **Restart injection.** Consolidation leases, spool claims and the
//!    fifth-attempt rule are all statements about what survives a process
//!    dying mid-flight, so the harness has to be able to kill one.
//!
//! Every constructor that needs PostgreSQL returns `Option`, matching the
//! existing `Server` convention: a checkout without `CAIRN_TEST_DATABASE_URL`
//! reports a skip rather than passing vacuously.
