//! Queued commands, delivered through the real HTTP boundary (T024–T027,
//! T039).
//!
//! ## Why this file exists
//!
//! The first drain mapped command kinds to `/api/commands/*` paths the server
//! does not serve, and posted the intent payload alone — so the deterministic
//! `command_id` never crossed the wire. Two defects with one cause: the wire
//! form did not carry the command. A compile-time enum-to-string mapping test
//! passed throughout, which is why there is no such test here.
//!
//! So every assertion below puts a command into `command_spool`, drains it over
//! HTTP against a real router, and looks at what the server actually did.
//!
//! ## What the harness has to do that is worth saying once
//!
//! `cairnd`'s drain is not linkable from here — it is a binary — so these tests
//! reproduce the wire form the daemon sends and post it themselves. The
//! envelope shape is asserted against the daemon's own builder in a unit test
//! in `sync.rs`, so the two cannot drift silently; what this file proves is
//! that the *server* honours it.
