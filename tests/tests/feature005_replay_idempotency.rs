//! Replay after a lost response, as a contract (T104, SC-716, FR-786).
//!
//! # The failure this file hunts
//!
//! The server accepts a batch and the response never reaches the daemon. From
//! the daemon's side that is indistinguishable from "the server never saw it",
//! so it must retry — and the retry has to be a no-op that reports success. A
//! naive implementation makes a second copy of everything the first delivery
//! made, and the copy is silent: no error, no refusal, just two canonical
//! events, two consolidation inputs, two memories.
//!
//! So the scenario is reproduced at the protocol level rather than by staging a
//! real outage: posting the identical batch N times **is** response loss,
//! exactly and deterministically, because the two are the same bytes on the
//! wire. An end-to-end outage — spool, drain, reconnect — is
//! `feature005_outage.rs`'s subject. What this file owns is the arithmetic:
//! however many times a delivery is repeated, one canonical event per distinct
//! event, one consolidation input, one durable effect.
//!
//! # Why "ten trials" and not one
//!
//! SC-716 says "any number of times" and "in 100% of trials". A single replay
//! proves the second delivery is handled; it says nothing about the tenth, and
//! nothing about a fresh session whose first delivery raced a second. So the
//! event tests replay ten times across ten independent sessions, and one of
//! them replays concurrently — the reservation and the `ON CONFLICT` are taken
//! inside a transaction precisely so two simultaneous deliveries collapse to
//! one effect, and a sequential-only test cannot see them being taken outside
//! it.
//!
//! # What is deliberately not here
//!
//! The transmission endpoint's own idempotency — repeating an outcome, and
//! refusing a conflicting one — is already held by `feature005_delivery.rs`
//! (`repeating_the_same_outcome_is_a_duplicate_with_no_second_effect`, which
//! asserts both the `delivered_context` row count and that the delivery
//! timestamp did not move, and
//! `an_opposite_terminal_outcome_is_refused_and_the_first_one_stands`).
//! Restating them here would be two tests failing for one defect. What that
//! file does not cover, and this one adds, is the *other* replay on that
//! surface: retrying the **retrieval** rather than the report must never
//! fabricate a delivery.
//!
//! Likewise `a_rolled_back_effect_leaves_the_command_replayable`
//! (`feature005_command_delivery.rs`) already proves a failed command's id is
//! not spent. The neighbouring property — a *succeeded* command's id is spent
//! forever, and stays spent across a server crash — is what this file asserts
//! instead.
