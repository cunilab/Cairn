//! Idempotency, paraphrase reinforcement and restart-safety, as a contract
//! (T044, `contracts/consolidation.md` §4, §4.1, §7, §7.1; `contracts/
//! extraction.md` §6, §7; SC-703, SC-736, SC-739).
//!
//! `feature005_consolidation_claims.rs` proves the claim machinery — leases,
//! attempts, ordering — with events that carry no real content, because it is
//! about the machinery and not about extraction. This file is the opposite
//! half: every event here is a real R1 "fix confirmed by tests" sequence
//! (`crates/cairn-server/src/extract.rs::rule_1_fix_confirmed_by_tests`), so
//! the deterministic extractor genuinely proposes, genuinely reinforces, and
//! genuinely gets interrupted mid-pipeline.
//!
//! # Why R1, specifically
//!
//! R7/R8 (`decision_signal`, `user_instruction_signal`) key off a
//! `VocabToken`, which must already be lower-case, dot/underscore-shaped and
//! justified by the session's own established vocabulary before ingest will
//! even accept it (`crates/cairn-core/src/event.rs::VocabToken::new`). That
//! makes them a poor vehicle for a *paraphrase* corpus: two différently-cased
//! or hyphenated wordings of the same token cannot both reach the wire in the
//! first place. R3/R5/R6 key their value on a digest of the exact command
//! text (`extract.rs::digest_token`), which is deliberately **not**
//! paraphrase-tolerant — two different wordings hash to two different values.
//! R1 is the one rule whose keys come from free text — a `test_command` and a
//! `repo_file` — folded through the same separator-folding
//! (`cairn_core::knowledge::normalize_topic_key`) that makes a paraphrase
//! corpus meaningful at all. So the paraphrase corpus
//! (`tests/feature005/corpora/paraphrase_pairs.json`) is written as wordings a
//! file stem or a command word could actually be (hyphen/case/slash/doubled-
//! separator variation; no bare space, since a space would split a command
//! line into two words), and the "representative subset...driven through the
//! real pipeline" below drives R1 with them.
//!
//! # Why this file starts its own `cairn-server` for every worker cycle
//!
//! `Pg::start`'s own server always runs with `--max-connections 4`
//! (`tests/src/lib.rs::Server::try_start_at`), and consolidation's pool share
//! is `min(2, floor(max_connections / 5))` — `floor(4/5) = 0`
//! (`contracts/consolidation.md` §6). A share of zero is a
//! `tokio::sync::Semaphore::new(0)` that `Consolidator::permit` can never
//! acquire, so `pg.server` **never attempts a single consolidation pass**,
//! restarted or not. `Pg::crash_and_restart` therefore cannot be the restart
//! injector for anything in this file — it restarts the wrong process. What
//! actually consolidates is a second `cairn-server`, started against the same
//! database with a pool large enough to earn a share
//! (`WORKER_POOL`), exactly as `feature005_consolidation_claims.rs` already
//! does. A "restart" here is: drop that process (killing it — see `Worker`'s
//! `Drop`) and start a fresh one at a fresh port on the *same database*. The
//! database, not the port, is the durable thing a restart must preserve, and
//! nothing in this file's assertions depends on the address staying fixed.
//!
//! # How a crash point is represented without racing a live worker
//!
//! A real process kill cannot be aimed at a millisecond-scale transaction
//! boundary, and it does not need to be: every consolidation pass commits in
//! at most three atomic steps — the claim transaction, the governance
//! transaction (extraction + persistence, one transaction — FR-808), and the
//! close transaction — and nothing is observable between them. So "crash
//! after governance committed, before close" is represented by **letting a
//! real pass run to completion once**, and then undoing only the three writes
//! the close transaction made (`consolidation_work` back to `pending`,
//! `consolidation_session` back to `claimed` with an expired lease,
//! `consolidation_runs` back to `running`) — leaving every row the governance
//! transaction wrote exactly as the real code left it. This is the same
//! technique `feature005_consolidation_claims.rs` already uses to represent
//! "a worker that died mid-pass": seeding the rows a crash would leave is the
//! faithful reproduction, because a crash is not observable as anything else.
//! No worker process runs while a scenario's rows are being arranged, so
//! nothing can race the seeding — see `Worker::start`/`drop` scoping in
//! `run_crash_point`.
//!
//! # A finding this file is expected to surface
//!
//! `consolidate.rs::govern`'s gate 6 looks up "does a project memory already
//! exist for this topic" (`project_by_topic`) with no exception for a memory
//! *this same session's own earlier attempt* durably created. A session that
//! crashes after its governance transaction commits a **new** (non-
//! reinforcing) memory, and is then reclaimed, will find its own prior
//! creation via that lookup and take the *reinforce* branch against it — a
//! spurious self-corroboration, an extra relation and an extra
//! `reinforcement_count`, none of which any second real occurrence produced.
//! `reinforce()` itself has no such gap (its endpoint is
//! `origin_kind = 'corroboration'`, which `project_by_topic` excludes by
//! name), so a *reinforcing* session's reclaim is safe. The tests below that
//! exercise a single session's own creation across a governance-committed
//! crash point are where this is expected to show up as a failure — see the
//! module-level report, not a defect in these assertions.
