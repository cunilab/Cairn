//! Consolidation's governance, as a contract (T043, `contracts/consolidation.md`
//! §5, §9), and adversarial privacy — SC-704, SC-705, SC-734, SC-735, SC-741,
//! SC-742, SC-749.
//!
//! The shipped extractor (`deterministic_v1`) cannot itself emit an
//! adversarial proposal: every rule in `extract.rs` hard-codes
//! `proposed_domain: KnowledgeDomain::Project`, and `CandidateProposal` has no
//! field for durability, verification, supersession, scope or authorization at
//! all (`contracts/extraction.md` §2, FR-805b). So "an adversarial proposal"
//! is driven the only way a real client can drive one: through event content
//! chosen so that, *if* governance ever read an extractor's wish rather than
//! deciding for itself, the outcome would differ. What these tests measure is
//! that it never does.
