//! Consolidation's claim machinery, as a contract (T031,
//! `contracts/consolidation.md` §4, §4.1, §6).
//!
//! What these tests are about is not "does consolidation produce knowledge" —
//! it does not yet, and US1 supplies the extractor. They are about the four
//! properties the claim machinery has to hold before an extractor is worth
//! writing:
//!
//! - **A group is not lockable; a row is.** PostgreSQL refuses a locking clause
//!   with `GROUP BY` (SQLSTATE 0A000), so the group that gets claimed is a
//!   `consolidation_session` row, elected `FOR UPDATE SKIP LOCKED ... LIMIT 1`
//!   and oldest first. One session per pass, and never the same session twice
//!   at once.
//! - **The attempt is counted at claim start, before the work runs.** A worker
//!   that dies mid-pass must have consumed its attempt; counting on failure
//!   instead is how a crash loop retries forever. The local spool had exactly
//!   that defect and it was repaired there (`crates/cairn-store/src/spool.rs`),
//!   so it is asserted here rather than trusted.
//! - **Five attempts means five that actually ran.** Failures 1–4 retry, a
//!   success on the fifth closes the event `done`, an unreported fifth becomes
//!   `failed`, and a sixth never starts.
//! - **Nothing strands a session.** Not a full batch, not a lease that outlived
//!   its worker, and not work that has exhausted its attempts.
//!
//! # Why these tests spawn their own `cairn-server`
//!
//! Consolidation's connection-pool share is `min(2, floor(max_connections / 5))`
//! and it does not run at all below `max_connections = 5` (§6, FR-793a1). The
//! shared harness deliberately starts servers with a pool of four, so the
//! fixture's own server never consolidates — which is a bound worth asserting
//! (see the pool-share test) and useless for exercising the machinery. So each
//! test that needs a worker starts a second `cairn-server` process against the
//! *same* database with a pool big enough to earn a share. That is a real
//! worker, not a mock: the same binary, the same code path, the same rows.
//!
//! # Why state is seeded with SQL rather than posted through ingest
//!
//! Two of the edge cases are defined by what a *crashed* worker left committed:
//! an attempt already counted, a lease already taken, a fifth attempt that never
//! reported. A crash is not observable as anything other than those rows, and
//! there is no wire message that produces them. Seeding the rows is therefore
//! the faithful reproduction, not a shortcut around one. The reopening test does
//! go through `POST /api/events/batch`, because reopening is exactly what the
//! ingest upsert does and a hand-written `UPDATE` would be testing this file.
