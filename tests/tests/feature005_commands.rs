//! The post-cutover command boundary, as a contract (T024,
//! `contracts/knowledge-commands.md` §3).
//!
//! ## Why this boundary exists at all
//!
//! Not a design preference — an audit finding. On `main`, `POST /api/sync/batch`
//! upserts a `memory` row with `ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE … WHERE
//! memories.project_id = $2`. Scoped to the *project*, not to the author: any
//! member of a project can overwrite any other member's memory content, state
//! and verification by naming its id. And `reinforcement_count`,
//! `verification`, `verification_authority` and the rest are bound straight from
//! the payload, so a client asserts derived state the server never computed.
//!
//! A command replaces the upsert with an **intent**. The server computes the
//! consequences, which is what makes the two problems disappear together: there
//! is no command that replaces another member's content, and there is no field
//! in which a client can assert a derived value.
//!
//! ## What is asserted here
//!
//! - **Intent only.** Every field in §3.1 is refused when present, one at a
//!   time, so a field that stopped being refused shows up as itself.
//! - **Identity from the credential.** Attribution is never read from the body
//!   (Principle XI).
//! - **No cross-member overwrite.** Correcting a colleague's knowledge is
//!   `supersede` — a new record, linked, attributed and reversible.
//! - **Retries are idempotent.** A command carries its own identity, so a
//!   client that could not record its own success does not write twice.
//! - **Personal is owner-only**, and no other owner is nameable.
//! - **Team transitions are atomic**, reusing the existing compare-and-swap.
