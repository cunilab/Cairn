//! Retrieval's deadline behaviour, measured rather than assumed (T081,
//! FR-835, FR-836, `contracts/retrieval-delivery.md` §5).
//!
//! # What is actually being pinned
//!
//! Not "retrieval is fast". A latency assertion on shared CI hardware measures
//! the runner, and a test that fails when a machine is busy teaches people to
//! re-run rather than to look. What FR-835 and FR-836 ask for is stronger and
//! cheaper to hold:
//!
//! - the level reached is one of exactly four, and never a fifth;
//! - the level is recorded on the answer **and** in the trace, and the two agree;
//! - **wall-clock latency is never itself an input to briefing content** — two
//!   retrievals over identical inputs at the same declared level return
//!   byte-identical content, however long either took.
//!
//! The last one is the falsifiable form of the claim, and it is the one a
//! caching or timing bug would break. Latency is recorded *about* a retrieval;
//! it must never leak *into* one.
