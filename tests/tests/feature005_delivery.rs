//! Delivery outcomes, and what may be claimed from them (T067,
//! `contracts/retrieval-delivery.md` §3, §6.2, §7, invariants 11 and 12).
//!
//! # The distinction the whole file is about
//!
//! Generating a briefing is not evidence that an agent received one. The two
//! are separate states written by separate parties at separate moments, and
//! every test here exists because collapsing them would let the first stand in
//! for the second — which is the overclaim Principle X forbids and the reason
//! `delivered_context` is written by the outcome report and never by selection.
//!
//! Acknowledgement is a third step further still, and nothing in this feature
//! can reach it: no named vendor mechanism establishes receipt for any
//! committed agent, so it stays `unavailable / no evidence` after every outcome
//! (FR-838e, FR-844, SC-712).
