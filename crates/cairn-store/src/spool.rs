//! The edge spools: approved events and knowledge commands waiting for the
//! server (`contracts/safe-events.md` §8, `contracts/knowledge-commands.md`
//! §4, `data-model.md` §1.4 and §5).
//!
//! Two tables, one protocol. Both retain per-author
//! claiming, stale-claim reclaim and backoff for Feature 004's sync queue, and
//! §8 of the contract is explicit that the spool reuses those semantics rather
//! than growing a second, subtly different set. What is genuinely new here is
//! everything the outbox never needed: an identity assigned from a durable
//! ordinal, and a capacity policy that may shed a capture event but must never
//! shed a boundary one.
//!
//! # Identity is assigned here, exactly once
//!
//! A hook is a separate short-lived process and cannot hold a counter; the
//! daemon can. So the ordinal comes from `session_event_seq` (events) or
//! `command_seq` (commands), is consumed inside the same transaction that
//! inserts the row, and the identity is derived from it by
//! [`cairn_core::eventid`]. Nothing recomputes it afterwards, so any number of
//! delivery retries carry the same id and the server answers `duplicate`
//! rather than storing a second event (FR-770).
//!
//! **The counter is never `MAX(session_seq)` over the spool.** The spool
//! drains, and sheds rows under the capacity policy below. A counter recovered
//! from the spool restarts at 1 the moment delivery empties a session's rows,
//! re-derives an `event_id` a delivered event already used, and the server —
//! being idempotent on that id — answers `duplicate` and silently discards a
//! real event. That is the failure this module's whole ordinal arrangement
//! exists to make impossible, so there is no statement here that reads an
//! ordinal from either spool table.
//!
//! # The account match is exact
//!
//! Rows stay bound to the account that authored them: a different signed-in
//! account neither delivers them nor sees them. Every claim predicate here
//! says `account_id = ?` and nothing else. A predicate of the shape
//! `account_id IS NULL OR account_id = ?` is how one identity comes to deliver
//! another's work under its own credential, and this repository has introduced
//! and repaired exactly that regression twice (FR-790, FR-864a). `account_id`
//! is `NOT NULL` in schema v8 so there is no NULL to open the door with, and
//! the predicates below do not offer one either.
//!
//! # Capacity, and the one event class that is never shed
//!
//! 50,000 events or 256 MiB, whichever binds first (`data-model.md` §3). On
//! overflow the oldest **capture-class** rows go first, each counted as
//! `spool_overflow_dropped`. When the bound is reached and nothing
//! capture-class is left, the spool does **not** start shedding boundary rows:
//! session open, close, resume and the two compaction events are what every
//! other event is interpreted relative to, so dropping one would not lose an
//! event, it would corrupt the reading of everything still queued. Instead the
//! store enters saturation, refuses new events, and counts each refusal as
//! `spool_saturated_dropped` (FR-785).
//!
//! Saturation is **derived**, never stored: it is the question "is the bound
//! reached and is nothing capture-class left", asked of the table. A column
//! would be a second copy of an answer the rows already give, and it would
//! have to be cleared by whoever drained the spool — which is precisely the
//! bookkeeping a derived predicate cannot forget to do. It clears the moment
//! delivery moves rows out of the undelivered set.

// - **Transient stays retryable, with bounded backoff and a bounded number of
//   attempts** (FR-784). `failed` is the retrying state, which is the opposite
//   of what the same word means in `outbox.rs`.
// - **Permanent refusals never retry.** No claim predicate here admits
//   `refused`, so the row is retried exactly zero times and stays where a
//   person can see it (FR-772).
// - **A `duplicate` answer is a success.** It is what a retry was *for*: at
//   most one canonical event exists, so the row is marked `delivered`
//   (FR-770, FR-786).
// - **Stale claims are reclaimable.** An `in_flight` row whose lease expired is
//   claimable again, so a drainer that died mid-send strands nothing.

/// The bound is the one `data-model.md` §3 already states, applied to both

/// what the command spool inherits from the event spool without mentioning
/// capacity at all. Refusing visibly is the reading that keeps FR-785's "the
