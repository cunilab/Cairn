//! The local integration record (FR-182–FR-184, D28, D28a, D19a).
//!
//! Everything in this module is machine-local. **No function here enqueues an
//! outbox row**, and there is deliberately no outbox entity type for any of
//! these tables: an agent configuration path, a content hash, or an
//! integration health detail must never reach the shared server (SC-120).
//!
//! The reference counting is the part worth reading. An `installed_resource`
//! is one *physical* thing — a file, a managed block, an entry. A
//! `resource_binding` is one agent's dependency on it. Connect ensures a
//! binding exists; disconnect ensures it does not; and a resource is deleted
//! only when its last binding goes. That is what keeps the shared `AGENTS.md`
//! block alive for OpenCode when Codex disconnects.
