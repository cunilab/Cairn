//! Fixtures for the daemon's component tests (tier 2, `docs/validation.md`).
//!
//! A `Daemon` over an in-memory store, built in microseconds. Everything the
//! daemon does to *storage* — reconciliation, idle reaping, link state, handoff
//! synthesis — is plain logic over that store, and needs neither a socket nor a
//! spawned process to exercise. Before this existed the only way to reach any of
//! it was to spawn `cairn` and `cairnd` and drive them over the wire, which is
//! why `cairnd` had nine unit tests for two and a half thousand lines.
//!
//! What this deliberately does *not* fake: the store is real SQLite with the
//! real schema, and the repository paths are real strings pointing at nothing.
//! A missing worktree is a state the daemon must already handle (FR-009), so
//! pointing at nothing is a fixture, not a mock.
//!
//! Paths sit under [`NOWHERE`] rather than `/tmp` so they cannot accidentally
//! resolve. A fixture under `/tmp` would read Git state successfully on any
//! host where `/tmp` happens to sit inside a checkout, and the tests that
//! assert the *missing-worktree* fallback would then pass without exercising
//! it.

/// Point `CAIRN_HOME` at a throwaway directory, once per test process.
///
/// # Why this exists
///
/// `cairn_core::paths::home()` falls back to the platform data directory when
/// `CAIRN_HOME` is unset, and `Daemon::mutate_credentials` writes `config.json`
/// and the token file through those paths. The store in these fixtures is
/// in-memory, so it looked as though nothing here touched the disk — but the
/// credential half does, and none of the twenty call sites in `sync.rs` set the
/// variable.
///
/// So `cargo test -p cairnd` wrote its fixtures into the developer's **real**
/// Cairn home. Observed on a developer machine: `config.json` carrying
/// `server_url: https://one.example` and a token file containing the literal
/// `token-a`, both straight out of the tests below, which unlinked that machine
/// from its server and left its outbox queued for a host that does not exist.
///
/// **Set once for the whole process, not per test.** `set_var` mutates state
/// every thread shares, and `cargo test` runs tests on many threads; setting it
/// repeatedly would race with the reads it is meant to fix. `Once` makes it a
/// single write, and every fixture funnels through `daemon_with`, so it happens
/// before anything can read a path.
///
/// **The directory is kept, and nothing deletes it.** It has to outlive every
/// test in the process, and a `TempDir` dropped at the end of `call_once` would
/// take it away while the suite was still running. `TempDir::keep` is the API
/// that says so; `mem::forget` would do the same thing while reading like an
/// oversight. Process exit does not remove it either, so each test run leaves
/// one directory of a few kilobytes under the system temp directory — which is
/// the price of not writing into the developer's real home, and is stated here
/// rather than described as cleanup that does not happen.
