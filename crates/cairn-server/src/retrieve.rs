//! Server-side retrieval, its trace, and the delivery outcome (T069, T070;
//! `contracts/retrieval-delivery.md`).
//!
//! # Why selection moved here
//!
//! Dedup is `relevant MINUS delivered PLUS changed`, and only the server holds
//! both sides of that comparison: a request carries a session, not the set of
//! what that session already received. A client-side `delivered_context` made
//! the rule uncomputable, and every prompt-time delivery would have restated
//! the session-open briefing.
//!
//! # The lifecycle is the point
//!
//! `requested → generated → transmitted | failed`, and each arrow is written by
//! a different party at a different moment. The server writes `requested`
//! before it selects anything, so a retrieval that dies mid-generation leaves a
//! record rather than nothing. Generation writes `generated` or a
//! generation-stage `failed`. **Only the daemon's later authenticated report
//! can write `transmitted`** — generating a briefing is not evidence that an
//! agent received one, and the two states exist precisely so that Cairn cannot
//! quietly claim the second on the strength of the first (FR-843, FR-854).
//!
//! `delivered_context` follows the same rule: a row is written when
//! transmission is reported and did not fail, never at selection. Writing it at
//! selection would suppress, for the life of the session, items the agent never
//! saw — dedup enforcing a delivery that did not happen.
//!
//! # What a trace may say
//!
//! Identities, budget accounting and a degradation level. Never the rendered
//! briefing: the text mixes domains and carries handoff-derived material, so
//! persisting it centrally would put one account's personal knowledge inside a
//! project-scoped record (FR-839).
