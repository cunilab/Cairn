        // has to keep its own pull position and its own backoff (FR-486,
        // FR-487, FR-488). Sharing the project route would couple a personal
        // pull to a project the personal domain does not belong to.

        // is, and for the same reason a namespace parameter is not used to
        // reach it: a parameter that selects a namespace is one edit away from
        // selecting an owner.

        // Unlike the two above, this one carries **tombstones**. A cache that

        // `forgotten_at` and no content.

        // either is refused before the handler runs — an agent has no tool
        // action shaped like ratification and must not gain one through a route
