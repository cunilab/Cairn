//! Semantic extraction (`contracts/extraction.md`; FR-763a–b, FR-805a–f).
//!
//! The extractor **proposes**; Cairn governs (`consolidate.rs`). Everything in
//! this module is a pure function of events that already crossed the privacy
//! boundary: no network, no model, no configuration that changes an output.
//!
//! # What a proposal cannot say
//!
//! [`CandidateProposal`] has no field for durability, verification,
//! supersession, scope, authorization or a privacy verdict. That is the design,
//! not an omission (FR-805b): an extractor cannot assert what it has no field
//! to assert, and structural prevention beats a procedural rule that somebody
//! has to keep remembering. The same reasoning puts the *governance* decisions
//! in `consolidate.rs` and not behind this trait.
//!
//! # Two rule tiers, and why the aggregator is not an extractor
//!
//! R1, R2, R4 and R7 are **session rules**: they read one session's ordered
//! events and [`DeterministicV1`] evaluates them from an [`ExtractionInput`].
//!
//! R3, R5, R6 and R8 need evidence across sessions — "≥3 sessions", "≥2
//! sessions". A session-scoped `ExtractionInput` cannot see that, and widening
//! it is not available: FR-805a1 confines an extraction request to one project
//! and one account context, and SC-749 tests it. So those four are evaluated by
//! [`aggregate`], **Cairn's own deterministic aggregator**, over data
//! `consolidate.rs` reads for one project. No extractor ever sees a
//! cross-session corpus, and the rules that most resemble policy claims about a
//! project are the ones no extractor influences at all.
//!
//! # Digests, not command text, in a project rule's value key
//!
//! `VALUE_KEY_MAX_CHARS` is 64 and `command_line` is up to 512 bytes, so R3,
//! R5 and R6 keying on the command itself would make a realistic command refuse
//! its own candidate as `key_normalization_failed`. They key on a bounded
//! digest instead (`contracts/extraction.md` §4).
