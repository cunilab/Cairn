//! The post-cutover knowledge command boundary
//! (`contracts/knowledge-commands.md` §3, FR-701, FR-712, FR-815–FR-816).
//!
//! ## Why this replaces an upsert
//!
//! Not a preference. An audit of `sync.rs` on `main` found two things about the
//! `memory` upsert:
//!
//! - its conflict predicate is `ON CONFLICT (id) DO UPDATE … WHERE
//!   memories.project_id = $2` — scoped to the **project**, not to the author —
//!   so any member of a project can overwrite any other member's memory
//!   content, state and verification by naming its id;
//! - `reinforcement_count`, `verification`, `verification_authority` and the
//!   rest are bound straight from the payload, so a client asserts derived state
//!   the server never computed.
//!
//! A command states an **intent** and the server computes the consequences,
//! which makes both problems disappear at once: there is no command that
//! replaces another member's content, and there is no field in which a client
//! can assert a derived value.
//!
//! ## The three rules every command here obeys
//!
//! 1. **Intent only.** Every field in §3.1 is refused when present, rather than
//!    ignored. Ignoring it would let a client believe it had taken effect.
//! 2. **Identity from the credential.** `owner_user_id`, `proposed_by_user_id`
//!    and the session behind `origin_session_id` come from the authenticated
//!    caller, never from the body (Principle XI). A body that could name them
//!    could attribute one account's work to another.
//! 3. **Retries are idempotent.** A command may carry its own `command_id`,
//!    derived on the client from a durable ordinal, so a client that could not
//!    record its own success does not write twice (FR-770 applied to commands).
//!
//! Correcting somebody else's knowledge is `supersede`: a new record, linked to
//! the old one, attributed to whoever made it and reversible — rather than a
//! silent overwrite.

/// A queued command has to reach the server carrying four things the
/// per-command routes cannot all express: its deterministic `command_id`, its
/// kind, whatever target it names, and its intent payload. The first version of
/// the drain posted `payload` alone to a path derived from the kind, which lost
/// the `command_id` — so nothing was idempotent — and named several paths the
/// server does not serve, so nothing was delivered either. Two bugs with one
/// cause: the wire form did not carry the command.
///
/// So the envelope carries all four, and dispatches **internally to the same
/// handlers** the direct routes call. There is one implementation of each
/// command's semantics; this is a second way in, not a second copy.
///
/// ## What the envelope may not carry
///
/// Nothing that decides who is acting. `account_id`, `owner_user_id`,
/// `proposed_by_user_id` and every verification authority are refused by
/// `reject_server_owned` on the payload, exactly as on a direct call, and the
/// account comes from the credential (Principle XI). The daemon cannot invent
/// authorization information because there is no field in which to put it.
///
/// ## Kinds this route does not carry yet — currently none
///
/// Every kind in `CommandKind` now dispatches to a real handler: pattern
/// promotion and forgetting since US3 (T085), and the two verification report
/// shapes since US6 (T128). The `deferred` helper that answered the rest is gone
/// with its last caller rather than kept against a future need — an unused
/// mechanism is one nobody is exercising, and this one would be re-derived in a
/// paragraph.
///
/// The *rule* it implemented still binds, and a kind added later must follow it:
/// answer `409 unsupported_kind`, never `404`. A `404` is read by the drain as
/// permanent, which marks the row terminal and loses the user's instruction; a
/// deferral is recognisable and non-terminal, so the row stays durable and lands
